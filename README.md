# POC
This proof of concept is created to test some of the features of a Spring Boot project.
The POC implements a employee log-in system with security features. It's backend is backed by a MySql database. The system implements not only authentication by verifying the user name and the password, it is also managed by role-based authorization. The admin account is pre-created with its own role-base privilege to create new users inside the backend database for verified employees. The various resources behind the features can be accessed via REST APIs, which are implemented using Spring Boot. The frontend UI part is being worked on and will be updated when finished.
