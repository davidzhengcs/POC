# POC
This proof of concept was created to test some of the features of a Spring Boot project.
The POC implements a employee managing system with security features. Its backend is backed by a MySql database. The system implements not only authentication by verifying the user name and the password, it is also managed with role-based authorization. The admin account is pre-created with its own role-based privilege to create new users inside the backend database for verified employees. The various resources behind the features can be accessed via REST APIs, which are implemented using Spring Boot. The frontend UI part is being worked on and will be updated when finished.
